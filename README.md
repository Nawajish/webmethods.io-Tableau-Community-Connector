# webmethods.io-Tableau-Community-Connector
This is a Webmethods.io community connector for [BambooHR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BambooHR), a cloud-based human resources (HR) software service. The connector uses the [BambooHR REST API](https://documentation.bamboohr.com/reference#get-employee-dependents-1) to make HTTP requests to access or modify a resource.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
This connector requires any [Node](https://nodejs.org/dist/) version between 8.14.0 and 10.14.2.

Note: If you have installed any other Node version on your system, you can:
1. Use tools to switch between different versions of Node

  - For Windows, use [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#installation--upgrades).
  
  - For Mac, use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
2. Build your app using your existing Node version and then transpile your code using a transpiler like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

The connector has been built with [wmiocli](https://docs.webmethods.io/integration/developer_guide/connector_builder/#gsc.tab=0), webmethod.io's iPaaS Connector Builder CLI tool, which must be installed. 

### Getting the API key 
To generate an API key, make a REST sign in request using Postman. 

### Installing
1. Clone the repo `https://github.com/yuvanmytri/webmethods.io-BambooHR-Community-Connector.git`.
2. Run `npm install -g @webmethodsio/wmiocli`.
3. Login to your webmethods.io tenant using `wmio login`.
4. Execute `wmio init` to get started.
5. Finally, execute `wmio deploy` to deploy this connector to your tenant.

Once deployed, itâ€™ll be automatically registered with webMethods.io Integration and will be available to you locally in the Connectors panel under the Services tab.

## Running the tests
